### Relay: Have a group or 2-4 people on a team do a relay of different activities such as
  - Running 
  - Stairs climbed
  - Minutes active
  - Calories burned

Each section would have a set time or distance to complete and after each player has completed the full relay the results would be displayed to a leaderboard and players would be ranked for each section of the relay to determine who did the best.
The activities could be selected for each relay so that the competing teams would have a fair game. A leaderboard would be implemented to keep players active and competitive.
